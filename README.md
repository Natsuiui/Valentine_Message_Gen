# Valentine_Message_Gen
Generating a message/poem using Tensorflow (Play generator example)

!THIS CODE IS NOT PERFECT!
Need more training data (this is copied and made into 1.6m characters by using only 18000 unique combinations!

EPOCHS should be changed to 20 from 50 to get reasonable training times and also to prevent overtraining of our data. 
The character generation will be directly copied and pasted instead of actually generating them.
Most of the explanation is given in the .ipynb code. Else refer to tensorflow's website to get more info.

Thanks,
Kshitij
