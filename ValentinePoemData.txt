How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.

who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,

so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.

And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.

As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

When butterflies dance among petals white,

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.

And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;

In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.

Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.

from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose

She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

which always sets my soul free.

When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

Are you a banana? Because I find you a-peel-ing.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,

Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.

What would I do without you by my side? Happy Valentine's Day to the love of my life.

To the most amazing woman who I am lucky enough to call my wife, Happy Valentine's Day.

Every day I wake up next to you feels like Valentine's Day.

You are the very brightest star of my life. Without you, I would not endure the dark night. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

I want to hold your hand forever as I have never ever met someone more special than you. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

After so many years of staying with each other, the only one thing that I understand is that I can't think of living without you! I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,

And is lost in balms

With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,

And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.

And all that's best of dark and bright

Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,

At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.

I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use

A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,

And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,

Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

To the most amazing woman who I am lucky enough to call my wife, Happy Valentine's Day.

Every day I wake up next to you feels like Valentine's Day.

You are the very brightest star of my life. Without you, I would not endure the dark night. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

I want to hold your hand forever as I have never ever met someone more special than you. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

After so many years of staying with each other, the only one thing that I understand is that I can't think of living without you! I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

You're my everything. Happy Valentine's Day!

Are you a banana? Because I find you a-peel-ing.

You're the only person I send heart eye emojis to.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.

I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.

Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,

And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,

The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

and made the sun to shine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine

And birds soaring in the sky,

A cold winter night
In your arms,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel

A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.

I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,

Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

When butterflies dance among petals white,

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.

And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

You take my breath away. Always.

In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

When butterflies dance among petals white,

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.

For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,

Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;

I've never been more happy,

Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.

Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.

The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few

For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,

Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.

Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

which always sets my soul free.

When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Happy Valentine’s Day to the most beautiful woman I know.

I love you, and I love us.

You take my breath away. Always.

You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.

But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.

I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.

Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,

Filled with fear and excitement,

And birds soaring in the sky,

I imagine

To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.

With all my love,
So that we know a love,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.

The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment

I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

How your smile spreads to your eyes,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,

so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.

They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.

Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.

Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.

and these tears I can't avoid,

I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

How your smile spreads to your eyes,

A cold winter night

The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;

your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms

Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.

And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -

As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.

I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,

I want to hold your hand forever as I have never ever met someone more special than you. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

After so many years of staying with each other, the only one thing that I understand is that I can't think of living without you! I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

You're my everything. Happy Valentine's Day!

Are you a banana? Because I find you a-peel-ing.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,

Filled with fear and excitement,

And birds soaring in the sky,

I imagine
That we break rules,

Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

I love you more than pizza.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,

Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.

And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover

Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,

As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,

Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.

May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.

The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.

But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,

Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion

Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.

Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,

The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.

I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,

There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.

And birds soaring in the sky,

A cold winter night

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms

They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.

and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.

I want to hold your hand forever as I have never ever met someone more special than you. I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

After so many years of staying with each other, the only one thing that I understand is that I can't think of living without you! I love you! Happy Valentine’s Day!

Every day, I want you to know that you will be my Valentine and you will be my Valentine for many more years to come! Happy Valentine’s Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

I'd change my orbit to banish the night,

How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.

And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,

It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine’s Day to the most special person in my life.

Here's to being my emergency contact someday.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -

And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
I hope you didn't mind.
I left it with the Archangel
who was standing just outside.

I left a note upon it.
Signed, to my Valentine.
The simple words were blurred
from the tears I could not hide.

You have enriched my life with laughter
and made the sun to shine.
I love you and I miss you,
Signed, your Valentine.

Sometimes when my heart is heavy,
and these tears I can't avoid,
I would rather have loved you for a moment
than to have an empty void.

Please save a place for me, my love.
I hope you wouldn't mind.
Remember that I love you,
Signed, your Valentine.

I imagine.
When I do,
I can only think of you.
How your smile spreads to your eyes,
Making me want to live in the moment forever.
I imagine
That we walk on paths,
Unknown to us,
Filled with fear and excitement,
Winding with happiness that is constant.
I imagine
That we see the dawn,
Bursting with resplendent hues,
And birds soaring in the sky,
Inviting us to hum along.
I imagine
That we break rules,
Do things our own way,
Travel the world,
To leave our traces.
I imagine
A cold winter night
In your arms,
Watching the snow,
Sitting at the window.
I imagine
The story of us
Has no end
Or beginning
But continues like the universe.
I imagine
I could fill your heart
With all my love,
So that we know a love,
Mysterious to this world.
I imagine
And wonder
What you would imagine,
With a smile extending to my eyes.

If I were an Artist, I'd paint pictures of you
Upon a canvas in lovely colourful hue.

If I were a Singer, I would sing you a song,
A beautiful melody to last you lifelong.

If I were an Actress, a starlet of the stage,
I'd play my part with finesse just for you always.

If I were a Dancer, I'd dance all through the night,
Just to be in your loving arms, holding me tight.

If I were a Poet, I'd write you a sonnet
With love and romance upon every line of it.

If I were an Author, I'd write our love story
That would light up the world with star-like bright glory.

If I were a Chef, I'd prepare a tasty meal,
A Valentine's special for my beau ideal.

Happy Valentine's Day!

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose
Come slowly, Eden
Lips unused to thee.
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
As the fainting bee,
Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums,
Counts his nectars—alights,
And is lost in balms
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
My life and all seemed turned to clay.
And then my blood rushed to my face
And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
And can return no more.
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea;
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah! longer, longer we.
Now, in the sea's red vintage melts the sun
As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
And Cleopatra-night drinks all- 'tis done,
Love, lay thine hand in mine.
Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart,
Glimmer, ye waves, 'round else unlighted sands;
Oh night! divorce our sun and sky apart-
Never our lips, our hands.
Love is enough: though the world be a-waning,
And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,
Though the skies be too dark for dim eyes to discover
The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,
Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,
And this day draw a veil over all deeds passed over,
Yet their hands shall not tremble, their feet shall not falter:
The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter
These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,
painting you rainbows when the rains come.
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,
as to keep you in my nurturing light.

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion
through time and space, our dance of devotion.

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,
your constant companion till stars align.
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.
I want to know you inside out,
I want to know it all -
It doesn't matter if it's important
Or if you consider it to be small.

Tell me all your secrets,
Tell me what makes you, you.
Tell me things you won't tell others -
What you have gone through.

Tell me what upsets you,
Tell me what you lack.
I won't tell it to anyone -
Dear, I've got your back.

Tell me what annoys you,
What makes you mad,
Things that you regret
Or things that make you sad.

Tell me all the reasons,
The reasons why you cry.
Let me make you laugh then;
At least let me try.

I don't know about future,
But this much you can be sure,
No matter what life brings you,
Together we can endure.
I've never imagined that there can be this day.
A day that love will find its way
Out of my heart and into your soul.
These feelings I have are beyond my control.

All my life I have waited patiently
For a goddess like you, so beautiful, so lovely.
Words can't express the way I feel.
These feelings toward you are all for real.

You are the reason why I go on.
Eternity can't separate this special bond.
This heart of mine is reserved for you.
Forever it is yours; this love is true.

I'll be your first and you'll be my last.
My world, my everything, till my time has passed.
I will always love you until the end of time.
MY LOVE, MY SWEETHEART, MY VALENTINE!

We belong to one another, like the body and soul.
You make me complete; you make me whole.
How much I love you is beyond any measure.
You are my wealth, you're the one I truly treasure.

We belong to one another, like the earth and the moon.
You are an answer to my prayers, you came as a boon.
How do I say what joy you bring and how much pleasure?
No one can discern it because it's beyond any measure.

We belong to one another, like the waves and the sea,
Because I am a part of you, and you are a part of me.
I now understand what it means to deeply care,
And I know true love is hard to find as it's indeed rare.

We belong to one another; this is how it is meant to be,
Because how else can I define our love logically.
I cannot describe how wonderful I feel,
But I know true love has the power to heal.

When love is so true and love is so pure,
There can't be heartache, for love is the cure.
And on this Valentine's Day, on this day of love,
I give this poem to the one I am so thankful of!

As we watch the sun go down,
I want to let you know,
my love for you is forever;
I'll never let you go.
You're the one I've been searching for,
the one I've finally found;
without you in my life,
my world wouldn't go round.
The love you bring into my heart,
which is so true and kind,
is something in no other
I could truly find.
You're the only one for me.
God tells me so
deep within my heart, mind, body and soul.
Today isn't just an ordinary Valentine's Day.
It's all about me and you,
about the love we share,
and how it will forever continue to grow.
It's not all about the chocolates or the dozen roses;
it's about the love we found,
how much we've been blessed.
Everything happens for a reason.
I believe this statement is true;
that's why you were sent to me
and I was sent to you.
I've never been more happy,
as I've been with you.
Even through the rough times,
we always make it through;
To be with you for eternity
is all I want for me and you.
All I want to say,
on our very first Valentine's Day, is:
I may not be your first love,
but I promise, with all my heart,
that I will be that one from up above,
your one and only, true love!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Verse:
All the cards that were written on the shelf
Can't tell you how I feel.
And this love that I have in my heart,
No one could ever steal.
To put my feelings into words
Would be so hard to do,
But the three words that I'll always say
Will be I Love You.

Chorus:
You will always be my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart,
And for you I'll give you everything,
Especially my heart.
And I will always let you know
Just what you mean to me.
In my heart my valentine
Is what you'll always be.

Verse:
Every day I thank the Lord above
For blessing me with you,
And there isn't anything you would say
That I wouldn't do.
This love that I have for you in my heart
Will never go away,
So I'll just keep on loving you
Every single day.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:

The candy will soon disappear,
And the flowers will die away,
But the love that I have for you in me -
That will always stay.

Chorus

So here's to you, my valentine,
My love and my sweetheart.
You will always be on my mind,
Even when we're far apart,
And I'll just keep on telling you
Just what you mean to me,
Because in my heart, my valentine,
Is where you'll always be.
Close, yes in my heart, my valentine, is what you'll always be.
Speak: Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart.

As long as the birds are singing,
As long as the fish can swim,
As long as the sun keeps shining,
I will love you in the bright or dim.

As long as the wind keeps blowing,
As long as the ocean waves,
As long as the stars are shimmering,
You will have my heart enslaved.

As long as time keeps flowing,
As long as the sky is blue,
As long as planets are spinning,
My love will forever be with you.

I want to give a special Valentine to you,
And I think I'm crushing, if you only knew.

Each day I feel like I'm floating on an endless cloud,
A weightless feather, a soft melodious sound.

As I look into your eyes, your beauty engulfs me.
I feel like I'm flying, soaring, sailing free.

I don't have things to give, like diamonds or pearls,
But all I want to do is make you my girl.

Happy Valentine's Day to you, and I must have to say,
That you are the girl that just makes my day!

You're so sweet, and gorgeous, I never want to part
'Cause you're the one that had stolen my heart.

I hope you feel Valentine's Day
is your favorite day this year,
because the first thing I'm gonna do
is hold you tight and shed a grateful tear.

And when night comes, in your strong arms
is the only place I wanna be,
so I can feel the pulse of your loving heart,
which always sets my soul free.

And in that magic moment in time
all I want to know is
that I am yours and you are mine.

On this romantic occasion,
I hope you will feel free to enjoy US this way
and lose yourself, consumed in my love,
making this our own unforgettable Valentine's Day!

I desire you when splinters of light appear
And the dew lazily joins morning sky.
When arias, pining birds to mates sing,
I want the soothing softness of your kiss.

I desire you when the sun centers the sky
And shadows hide beneath the soles of feet.
When butterflies dance among petals white,
I want the sparkle of your smiling eyes.

I desire you as the moon welcomes the night
And skies are flooded with twinkling bright stars.
When candles flicker their last silent breath,
I then want to feel your sensuous touch.

I desire you when passion swells all your soul
And your lovely face shines with radiance.
When your moist lips are full of love's desire,
I want to feel every pulse of your heart.

I desire you when you are weary and down
And gray skies sprinkle droplets of sad tears.
When the world laughs at your every stumble,
I want to gently sooth your sorrows.

I desire you my love in every moment.
As time adds years like sands on the beach,
When you sense your beauty slipping to the wind,
I will want you so much more than now.

I could watch the sunrise, I could watch the sunset.
I could walk in the rain without getting wet.
I could witness their beauty as the flowers bloom.
I could I could listen to bird songs as the new day dawns.
I could feel the sunshine through the darkest clouds.
I could hear a sweet whisper through the roar of a crowd.
I could walk on water without soaking my feet.
I could travel the world in less than a week.
I could ponder the knowledge passed down by the wise.
I could dwell in a castle built in the sky.
I could paint a portrait and bring it to life.
I could sleep without pain, on the edge of a knife.
I could play a sweet melody to soften the mood.
I could take all the bad and turn it to good.
I could float on the breeze, I could fly on the wind.
I could soar high in the sky, leaving the world behind.
I could travel the cosmos and watch it unfold.
I could witness its power, so wonderful to behold.
But of all the wonderful things I could do,
There's nothing in the universe that compares to you.
I'll hold you in my heart for the rest of my life.
You're my living miracle, my sweet valentine.

If words can mean so much,
And prove my love for you,
I'll never lose my touch,
And my love will be ever new.

Words, there are a lot,
Yet good ones are so few
To describe the love I've got,
For my dearest darling, you.

If hugs and kisses are gold,
And can keep you always close,
My love will never run cold,
Since you're the one I love the most.

Hugs can connect our hearts,
Kisses unite our souls,
And we'll never be apart,
If grace on us God bestows.

If I am your everything,
I who am but dust,
Then to you I'll ever cling,
My treasure that will never rust.

For I do not deserve any love at all,
Yet you have made me your love,
And for you I cannot help but fall,
For you are a blessing from above.

Eternity starts with me and you,
And may it never end,
May it remain faithful and true,
And may you always be my life, love, and best friend.

I sent a rose to you today.
